# Teaching styles and learning

* Design thinking
* Lucky enough to have followed design thinking workshops while at Google, and used it in my professional life
* Key idea: put your ideas to the test. Show it early, show it often, iterate.
* You can apply the same idea to designing your life. There was an episode of Hidden Brain on the subject, and it's a nice soothing listen (as usual).
* The advice boils down to: rather than imagining how something will be like, take the plunge immediately in little ways, learn something from it, and then extrapolate.
* Call it anchored imagination.
* Since I'm contemplating an academic career, I figured I would have to teach at some point - and would need to write a teaching statement.
* "I should teach and see what that's like"
* I got a chance to do that at a community college in the outskirts of Montreal
* It was an interesting and challenging experience. I won't go into much details, but I think Richard Gao did a great job explaining how stressful teaching and creating a class can be.

## Project-based learning is a trap

* I want to focus here on this idea of project-based learning, and whether it's a good idea to use that.
* Project-based learning is centered around the learner - instead of a passive learner that receives information, plain and simple, the learner becomes an active participant and directs their own learning
* The opposite of project based learning could be viewed as lecture-based learning, where the teacher
* (Ironically, my own project-based learning experience with teaching was based on this premise)
* With project-based learning, the learner is assumed to engage with the material in different ways: visual, auditory, in written form, in interactive media, in video, etc.
* What it's very good for: motivation. Because there's an end-goal in mind, and it's very easy to focus students on the end-goal, motivation remains mostly high.
* However, it encourages shallow learning - learning just enough to scrape by. Copy-and-paste type of learning is all too common in the workplace, where efficiency and immediate results are expected; learning environments should offer the student the possibility of creating a full scaffold
* There's an interesting section in the book by Dehaene called How We Learn. He discusses the enthusiasm in the 70's over self-directed learning in the context of learning how to code (Seymour Papert and the invention of Logo). He concludes that children who are taught the basics of LOGO did not go on to acquire deep knowledge of computer science, nor elementary knowledge of code organization. 
   * Point: Imagine "discovering" Dijsktra's algorithm by playing around with Logo! That's not how life works! The amazing thing about education is that we can teach newbs in 15 minutes something that took years for dozens of smart people to figure out!
   * Counterpoint: this was before the advent of the internet. Lots and lots of educational materials are available online now. If someone had just learned LOGO and they wanted to go *deeper*, they're only a couple of clicks away from the information that will allow them to go deeper. Furthermore, adults are not children. They generally have better meta-cognition and learning strategies that will lead them to acquire more information by themselves.
   * Counter-counterpoint: The information-on-demand that students are likely to consume will be in a style that resembles a demonstration (e.g. a Youtube tutorial) or that follows the semantics of a book. In other words, it recapitulates the kind of traditional classroom learning that project-based learning is supposed to supplant. The search for this material represents a tax on learning. Not all the material will be appropriate for their level.
* Project-based challenges can easily breed discouragement, because you'll want to accomplish something that no one has done before - and from the point of view of the learner, not accomplishing the thing feels just as frustrating whether you make dumb mistakes or because the thing you're trying to do is literally impossible.
* Conclusion: Project-based learning is good for motivation - it breeds a lot of intrinsic motivation which keeps students going. In a classroom where people are at heterogeneous levels of competence at the start, it can lead more advanced students to keep motivated (there's always more challenges!) while keeping the students who are struggling engaged.
* Related idea: grad-school is mostly project-based learning.

### Lecture based learning is a trap

- Forces students into the same funnel, regardless of pre-existing knowledge - bad for students at both extremes.
- Forces everybody to acquire building blocks which may not be immediately obvious. My philosophy teacher in cegep said to our class once: if you want to improvise the guitar, you have to learn how to play other people's songs first! Otherwise you're always going to play garbage. Hence he encouraged us to create philosophical papers with an intro, three arguments, and a conclusion. It wasn't original, but it was a scaffold we could build on.
- Only real way to teach hard things that require mental leaps of faith. E.g. complex numbers are equivalent to (a class of) 2-by-2 matrices. Mind blown! How was I supposed to guess that by myself! That stuff is hard.

### Somewhere in the middle is where it's at.

* Technological aides that can teach students the sub-parts of what they're trying to learn. Unfortunately even MOOCs, which in theory could create personalized learning, mostly fail to do this - we're still in a lecture-obsessed world. 
* Understanding what a person understands (and doesn't understand) is a skill that computers have yet to learn (although see some efforts aout modelling meta-cognition by Tenenbaum et al.). 
* In the meantime, part of teachers role (of excellent teachers) in a small classroom setting is to engage in metacognition about students
* This require eye contact, a high density of feedback between teacher and students (1 to 5 fingers!), consistent testing (which helps retention tremendously).
* You also need to manage attention. In most classes these days, most people are on their computers of laptop at most times. This is very difficult to get away from if the thing you're trying to do is on the computer (e.g. programming). I don't know how to wean people off of Facebook effectively, but I think it's one of the most disruptive things that technology has brought.
* If you break the cycle of attention - you break the cycle of feedback. Without feedback, meta-cognition is compromised. With meta-cognition, the course takes years to improve - not weeks. 
* In the absence of the right technology, conventional: 
   1. lectures that build on fundamentals. The first few can be canned at the start of the semester, but time should be alloted freely to allow catch up time as difficulties are encountered (like when I realized my students didn't understand functions).
   2. projects that start at the start of the semester, and that cover everything in a cumulative fashion. Reviewing everything is an excellent way to encourage long term retention.
   3. weekly exercises (short)
   4. daily pop-quizzes, immediately corrected. Assessments help retention and nothing gets students off of Facebook more effectively then "we have a quiz in 15 minutes"
* Managing attention becomes so important in this context that techniques that teachers need techniques to manipulate attention. I took improv comedy classes in San Francisco (yes, I'm a stereotype). I used improv games to keep students awake. Improv only really works when the participants are deeply listening to each other and are fully engaged in the situtation (yes anding). 
   * Problem: people that take improv classes are often busy people with families and work lives and phones ringing so if you just let them be that's all they'll be focusing on. 
   * Answer: Improv games are often used at the start of improv classes to bring people into an open mindset in which they're *out of their heads* (or off of their phones). They're high energy games that require people to listen for signs from others or otherwise it doesn't work. These games are highly effective. For example: crazy 8's. Upcounting. Ticky-tacky.
